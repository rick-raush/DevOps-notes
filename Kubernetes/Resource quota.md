## 🔹 What is a Kubernetes ResourceQuota?

A **`ResourceQuota`** is an object that enforces limits on the resources used by all objects (like pods, services, etc.) in a **namespace**.

It is commonly used to:

- Prevent a single team or application from using too much of the cluster's resources.
    
- Control the cost and stability of applications.
    
- Enforce policies in multi-tenant environments.
    

&nbsp;

In **Kubernetes**, there are several **types of quotas** that you can apply using the `ResourceQuota` object. These quotas fall into different **categories based on what they control**, such as compute resources, object counts, storage, and scope-based quotas.

Here’s a breakdown of the main **types of quotas in Kubernetes**:

* * *

## 🔹 1. **Compute Resource Quotas**

These quotas limit the **total amount of CPU and memory** that pods in a namespace can request or use.

| Resource Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `requests.cpu` | Total amount of CPU requested by all pods. |
| `limits.cpu` | Total CPU usage limit across all pods. |
| `requests.memory` | Total amount of memory requested. |
| `limits.memory` | Total memory usage limit. |

📌 **Use case:** Control how much compute power a team or app can use.

* * *

## 🔹 2. **Object Count Quotas**

These quotas limit the **number of Kubernetes objects** that can be created in a namespace.

| Resource Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pods` | Maximum number of pods. |
| `services` | Max number of services. |
| `replicationcontrollers` | Max number of ReplicationControllers. |
| `secrets` | Max number of Secrets. |
| `configmaps` | Max number of ConfigMaps. |
| `persistentvolumeclaims` | Max number of PVCs. |
| `statefulsets.apps` | Max number of StatefulSets. |
| `deployments.apps` | Max number of Deployments. |

📌 **Use case:** Prevent users from spamming the cluster with too many objects.

* * *

## 🔹 3. **Storage Resource Quotas**

These quotas limit how much **persistent storage** can be requested by PVCs (PersistentVolumeClaims).

| Resource Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `requests.storage` | Total amount of storage requested across PVCs. |
| `persistentvolumeclaims` | Max number of PVCs. |
| `requests.<storage-class>.storage` | Limit storage per StorageClass. |

📌 **Use case:** Prevent storage overuse, especially in multi-tenant environments.

* * *

## 🔹 4. **Scope-Based Quotas**

These are **quotas that only apply to specific types of workloads**, using **scopes**. You define the scope in the `scopeSelector` or `scopes` field.

| Scope Type | Applies To |
| --- | --- |
| `BestEffort` | Pods that do not specify any resource requests/limits. |
| `NotBestEffort` | Pods that *do* specify resource requests/limits. |
| `Terminating` | Pods with `activeDeadlineSeconds` (i.e., temporary pods). |
| `NotTerminating` | Pods without `activeDeadlineSeconds`. |

📌 **Use case:** Enforce different quotas for production vs. temporary or low-priority pods.

* * *

## 🔹 5. **Extended Resource Quotas**

You can also define quotas for **custom or extended resources**, such as GPU usage.

| Example | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `requests.nvidia.com/gpu` | Total number of GPUs requested. |

📌 **Use case:** Limit access to specialized hardware like GPUs.

* * *

## ✅ Example of Mixed ResourceQuota

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: mixed-quota
  namespace: dev   #<------the target namespace
spec:
  hard:
    pods: "10"                         # Max number of pods
    services: "5"                      # Max number of services
    replicationcontrollers: "3"       # Max number of replication controllers
    secrets: "10"                     # Max number of secrets
    configmaps: "10"                  # Max number of configmaps
    persistentvolumeclaims: "5"       # Max number of PVCs
    statefulsets.apps: "3"            # Max number of StatefulSets (note the '.apps' suffix)
    deployments.apps: "4"              # Max number of Deployments (note the '.apps' suffix)

    requests.cpu: "4"
    limits.cpu: "8"
    requests.memory: "8Gi"
    limits.memory: "16Gi"
    requests.storage: "100Gi"
```

* * *

## Summary Table

| Type | Limits On | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Compute Resources | CPU and memory requests/limits | Prevent resource exhaustion |
| Object Count | Number of Kubernetes objects | Prevent object spamming |
| Storage Resources | PVCs and storage amounts | Control storage use |
| Scope-Based | Specific pod types (e.g., BestEffort) | Prioritize workloads |
| Extended | GPUs, custom resources | Limit specialized resources |

# Automatic Assignment of Resource Requests in Kubernetes

### Key behavior:

- **If a container specifies a CPU or memory *limit* but does NOT specify a corresponding *request*, Kubernetes automatically sets the *request* equal to the *limit*.**

* * *

### Why does Kubernetes do this?

- The **scheduler needs resource requests** to decide where to place Pods.
    
- The **ResourceQuota enforcement requires requests to be defined** to track resource usage accurately.
    
- Automatically assigning requests equal to limits **ensures Pods have valid requests**, even if you omit them explicitly.
    

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**`LimitRange` and `ResourceQuota` are deeply connected** in Kubernetes.

Let’s clarify their relationship step by step:

* * *

## ✅ **LimitRange came into the picture because ResourceQuota needs requests/limits to enforce quotas**

### 💡 Here's the situation:

### 🟨 Problem:

When using a **`ResourceQuota`**, for example:

```yaml
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "4"
    limits.cpu: "8"
```

Then **every Pod must specify**:

- `resources.requests`
    
- `resources.limits`
    

Otherwise, Kubernetes doesn’t know **how much to count** toward the quota, so:

> ❌ **The Pod will be rejected** if it doesn't include `requests` and `limits`.

* * *

### ✅ Solution: Use a **LimitRange**

A `LimitRange`:

- Automatically **fills in** missing `requests` and/or `limits` for a container
    
- Ensures that all Pods in the namespace are **compatible with the ResourceQuota**
    
- Prevents users from forgetting to set those values manually
    

* * *

## 🔄 Workflow Example: How They Work Together

### 1️⃣ You define a **ResourceQuota**:

```yaml
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "4"
    limits.cpu: "8"
```

### 2️⃣ You apply a **LimitRange**:

```yaml
spec:
  limits:
  - type: Container
    defaultRequest:
      cpu: "200m"
    default:
      cpu: "500m"
```

### 3️⃣ User creates a Pod **without specifying resources**:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: busybox
  namespace: dev
spec:
  containers:
  - name: test
    image: busybox
    command: ["sleep", "3600"]
```

### 🔁 What Kubernetes does:

- `LimitRange` fills in:
    
    - `requests.cpu = 200m`
        
    - `limits.cpu = 500m`
        
- These are **counted toward the quota**:
    
    - `requests.cpu` used = 200m
        
    - `limits.cpu` used = 500m
        

✅ Pod is accepted  
✅ Quota is enforced  
✅ User didn't have to manually define resources

* * *

## ✅ Summary

| Feature | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ResourceQuota` | Enforces total resource usage limits for a namespace |
| `LimitRange` | Sets defaults and bounds for per-container resource requests and limits |
| Why Needed Together? | **Quota can only be enforced if requests/limits exist**, and `LimitRange` ensures they do |

* * *

## 🔥 TL;DR

> **LimitRange exists to ensure that Pods have valid `requests` and `limits`, which are necessary for `ResourceQuota` to work.**

Without `LimitRange`, ResourceQuota **may reject** any Pod that doesn't explicitly specify resources.

* * *

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Let's compare **ResourceQuota** and **LimitRange** using side-by-side YAML examples and a breakdown of their differences and how they work together in a Kubernetes **namespace**.

* * *

## 🧾 **1\. LimitRange YAML**

This sets **default values** for container `requests` and `limits`, and also enforces **min/max constraints**.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: container-limits
  namespace: dev
spec:
  limits:
  - type: Container #The type field specifies which kind of resource the limit applies to. 
  		    #It determines the scope of the limits and defaults defined in that particular limit rule.
    min:
      cpu: "100m"
      memory: "128Mi"
    max:
      cpu: "1"
      memory: "1Gi"
    defaultRequest:
      cpu: "200m"
      memory: "256Mi"
    default:
      cpu: "500m"
      memory: "512Mi"
```

### 🔍 What this does:

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `min` | Minimum allowed resource request/limit |
| `max` | Maximum allowed resource request/limit |
| `defaultRequest` | Automatically applied **request** if user doesn’t set one |
| `default` | Automatically applied **limit** if user doesn’t set one |

&nbsp;

* * *

## 🧾 **2\. ResourceQuota YAML**

This enforces **resource usage limits across the namespace**.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: dev-quota
  namespace: dev
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "2"
    requests.memory: "4Gi"
    limits.cpu: "4"
    limits.memory: "8Gi"
    pods: "10"
    persistentvolumeclaims: "5"
    requests.storage: "100Gi"
```

### 🔍 What this does:

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `requests.cpu` / `requests.memory` | Total **requested** CPU/memory allowed in namespace |
| `limits.cpu` / `limits.memory` | Total **limits** allowed in namespace |
| `pods` | Max number of Pods allowed in namespace |
| `persistentvolumeclaims` | Max number of PVCs |
| `requests.storage` | Total storage allowed via PVCs |

* * *

## 🧠 Comparison: **LimitRange vs ResourceQuota**

| Feature | `LimitRange` | `ResourceQuota` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scope | Per **Pod/Container** | Whole **namespace** |
| Purpose | Set default & min/max for resource requests/limits | Enforce total usage caps |
| Applies to | Individual containers | Namespace-level totals |
| Auto-fills missing values | ✅ Yes (`defaultRequest`, `default`) | ❌ No |
| Prevents overuse | ✅ Per container | ✅ Per namespace |
| Rejects pods that exceed limits | ✅ If outside min/max | ✅ If over quota |

* * *

## 🔗 How They Work Together

1.  **`LimitRange`** ensures that all containers have appropriate request/limit values.
    
2.  If a Pod doesn't define them ➝ `LimitRange` fills them in.
    
3.  Then Kubernetes checks those values against the **`ResourceQuota`**.
    
4.  If the namespace is within quota ➝ Pod is admitted ✅
    
5.  If the new Pod would exceed quota ➝ Pod is rejected ❌
    

* * *

## ✅ Best Practice

- Use **LimitRange** to avoid missing requests/limits and enforce sane defaults.
    
- Use **ResourceQuota** to prevent any team/app from using too much of the cluster's shared resources.
