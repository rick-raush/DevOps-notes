⚙️ What is a Resource Request?

In **Kubernetes**, a **resource request** defines the **minimum amount of CPU and memory (RAM)** a container **is guaranteed** to get.

Kubernetes uses this information to:

- **Schedule** the Pod on a node that has enough available resources
    
- Ensure the container has **enough resources to run reliably**
    
- Improve **resource planning and cluster stability**
    

* * *

## 📦 Resources You Can Request

- **CPU** → Measured in **cores** (1 CPU = 1 core)
    
- **Memory** → Measured in **bytes** (e.g., `Mi`, `Gi`)
    

* * *

## 🔹 Syntax Example (in a Pod or Deployment)

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "512Mi"
    cpu: "250m"      # 250 millicores = 0.25 core
```

This means:

- Kubernetes guarantees the container gets **512Mi of memory** and **0.25 CPU**
    
- The scheduler won’t place it on a node that can’t give it at least that much

## 💡 Resource Requests vs Limits

| Term | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Request** | The **minimum** guaranteed resource (used for scheduling) |
| **Limit** | The **maximum** resource a container can use |

### Example:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "512Mi"
    cpu: "250m"
  limits:
    memory: "1Gi"
    cpu: "500m"
```

🧠 This means:

- Container is **guaranteed 0.25 CPU and 512Mi memory**
    
- Can **burst up to 0.5 CPU and 1Gi memory**
    
- If it tries to use more than the limit, it may be **throttled (CPU)** or **killed (Memory)**
    

* * *

## 📌 Why Are Requests Important?

1.  ✅ **Scheduling**  
    Pods won't be scheduled to a node unless it can fulfill the resource requests.
    
2.  ✅ **Fairness**  
    Helps prevent noisy neighbors (one pod hogging all the resources).
    
3.  ✅ **Stability**  
    Avoids memory crashes or CPU starvation by planning ahead.
    
4.  ✅ **Autoscaling**  
    Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Cluster Autoscaler use requests to make scaling decisions.

## 📊 Units Reference

| Type | Unit | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CPU | `m` | millicores (1000m = 1 core) |
| Memory | `Mi` | Mebibytes (1Mi = 1024^2 bytes) |
| Memory | `Gi` | Gibibytes (1Gi = 1024^3 bytes) |

* * *

## 🧠 TL;DR

- **Requests = Minimum guaranteed resources**
    
- Used by Kubernetes **to decide where to schedule the pod**
    
- Helps ensure your app gets the resources it needs
    
- Can (and should) be paired with **limits** to control max usage

# M vs Mi

This is likely **memory usage** as reported by monitoring tools (like `kubectl top pod`, `htop`, or `docker stats`

| Format | Means | Equivalent To |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `23M` | 23 Megabytes | ~23,000,000 bytes (decimal) |
| `23Mi` | 23 Mebibytes | 23 × 1024 × 1024 = 24,107,264 bytes (binary) |

🔸 **M** = **MB** (Megabytes, decimal, base 10)  
🔸 **Mi** = **Mebibytes** (binary, base 2)
