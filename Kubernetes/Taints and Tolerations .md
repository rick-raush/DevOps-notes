**Taints and Tolerations** 

They help enforce **workload isolation, scheduling rules**, and **dedicated node usage** (e.g., for GPUs, system workloads, etc.).

* * *

## 🚫 **What is a Taint?**

A **taint** is applied to a **Node**, and it says:

> "Don’t schedule any Pods on me **unless** they explicitly **tolerate** this taint."

It's a way for nodes to **repel** Pods unless the Pod is specially configured.

### 📌 Example: Add a taint to a node

```bash
kubectl taint nodes node1 key=value:NoSchedule
```

This adds a taint:

```
key=value:NoSchedule
#key operator value effect
```

This means:

- Pods **will not** be scheduled on `node1` **unless they have a matching toleration**.

* * *

## ✅ **What is a Toleration?**

A **toleration** is added to a **Pod**, and it says:

> "I am okay (I tolerate) being scheduled on a node with this specific taint."

So, tolerations **don't force** a Pod onto a tainted node — they just **allow** it to be scheduled there if other conditions match.

* * *

## 🔁 How They Work Together

| Node Has Taint | Pod Has Matching Toleration | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Yes | Yes | ✅ Pod can run there |
| Yes | No  | ❌ Pod will not run there |
| No  | Doesn't matter | ✅ Pod can run there |

* * *

## 🔧 Example: Taint + Toleration

### ➤ Taint a Node:

```bash
kubectl taint nodes node1 env=prod:NoSchedule
```

Now, only Pods with this toleration can run on `node1`.

### ➤ Pod with Matching Toleration:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1

kind: Pod

metadata:
  name: tolerant-pod

spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
  
  tolerations:
  - key: "env"
    operator: "Equal" # <-- Default operator if we skip this part
    value: "prod"
    effect: "NoSchedule" # <-- if we write effect: "" then it tolerates any effect in the give key=value pair
```

This Pod says: “I tolerate `env=prod:NoSchedule`” → so it **can** be scheduled on `node1`.

* * *

## 🧠 Taint Effects

| Effect | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `NoSchedule` | Don't schedule Pods unless they have a matching toleration |
| `PreferNoSchedule` | Try to avoid scheduling Pods here unless no better option |
| `NoExecute` | Evict existing Pods unless they tolerate the taint |

* * *

## 🔍 View Taints on a Node

```bash
kubectl describe node <node-name>
```

Look under the **Taints** section.

* * *

## 🚀 Common Use Cases

- **Dedicated nodes** for production workloads
    
- **GPU nodes** only for ML jobs
    
- **Critical system Pods** on control-plane nodes
    
- **Isolating tenant workloads** (multi-tenant clusters)
    

* * *

&nbsp;

## 🛑 What is the `NoExecute` Effect?

When a **node** has a taint with the effect `NoExecute`, it means:

- **Pods that do NOT tolerate this taint are immediately evicted from the node.**
    
- **Pods that DO tolerate the taint can stay (or be scheduled) on the node.**
    

So `NoExecute` is a stronger effect compared to `NoSchedule` because it **actively evicts** Pods rather than just preventing scheduling new ones.

&nbsp;

Removing a taint from a node is straightforward with `kubectl taint` command by using a **minus (`-`) at the end of the taint spec**.

* * *

## ✅ Remove a Taint from a Node

### Syntax:

```bash
kubectl taint nodes <node-name> <key>=<value>:<effect>-
```

Note the **trailing dash (`-`)** which tells Kubernetes to **remove** the taint.

* * *

### Example:

If you tainted your node like this:

```bash
kubectl taint nodes node1 key=value:NoSchedule
```

Remove it by running:

```bash
kubectl taint nodes node1 key=value:NoSchedule-
```

* * *

### To confirm the taint is removed:

```bash
kubectl describe node node1 | grep Taints
```

If no taints remain, you’ll get no output.

* * *

## 🔍 How to remove all taints?

If you want to remove **all taints** from a node, you can:

```bash
kubectl taint nodes node1 <key1>=<value1>:<effect1>-
kubectl taint nodes node1 <key2>=<value2>:<effect2>-
# and so on for each taint
```

* * *

## 🧠 Quick tip:

If you’re unsure what taints exist on a node:

```bash
kubectl describe node <node-name> | grep Taints
```

* * *

Great question!

You're asking whether this command:

```bash
kubectl taint nodes node1 <key1>-
```

can be used to **remove a taint by just specifying the key**, like:

```bash
kubectl taint nodes node1 key-
```

* * *

## ✅ **Short Answer:** Yes, **but only if the key is unique on the node**.

This **does work**, and it's a shorthand for removing **any taint with that key**, regardless of its `value` or `effect`.

* * *

## 🔍 When It Works:

Let’s say your node `node1` has this taint:

```text
key1=value1:NoSchedule
```

Then running:

```bash
kubectl taint nodes node1 key1-
```

✅ **This will remove the taint**, because it matches the `key`.

* * *

## 🔧 Recommendation:

Use the full syntax unless you're sure there's only one taint with that key:

```bash
kubectl taint nodes node1 key=value:effect-
```

But if you know there's only one taint with that `key`, then this works:

```bash
kubectl taint nodes node1 key-
```

What happens when certain fields in Kubernetes tolerations are omitted or set in specific ways:

* * *

# Kubernetes Tolerations: What Happens When Fields Are Omitted or Empty

### 1\. **Omitting `value`**

| Operator | Is `value` Required? | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Equal` | **Yes** | Must specify a `value`. Omitting causes validation error. |
| `Exists` | **No** | `value` is optional and usually omitted. Matches any value. |

**Example:**

```yaml
tolerations:
- key: "env"
  operator: "Exists"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
```

Tolerates any taint with key `env` and effect `NoSchedule`, regardless of value.

* * *

### 2\. **Setting `effect: ""` (empty string)**

| Resource Type | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Taint** | ❌ Invalid — causes an error. Must be one of `NoSchedule`, `PreferNoSchedule`, or `NoExecute`. |
| **Toleration** | ✅ Valid — matches taints with any effect (all three). |

**Effect in toleration empty means:**

> "Tolerate taints with this key/value regardless of effect."

* * *

### 3\. **Empty or omitted `key`**

| `key` Value | Allowed `operator` | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `""` (empty) | Only `Exists` | Tolerate **all** taints with any key and value. |
| Non-empty | `Exists` or `Equal` | Match specific key or key/value pair. |

**Note:**

- `key: ""` with `operator: Equal` is **invalid**.
    
- `key` cannot be omitted if `operator` is `Equal`.
    

* * *

### 4\. **Omitting `operator`**

- Defaults to `Equal`.
    
- Must provide `value` if `operator` is `Equal`.
    

* * *

# **Summary Table**

| Field | Omitted/Empty Value | Valid? | Behavior/Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `value` | Omitted with `Equal` | ❌   | Error: value required |
| `value` | Omitted with `Exists` | ✅   | Valid: matches any value |
| `effect` | `""` (empty) in taint | ❌   | Error: effect required (`NoSchedule`, etc.) |
| `effect` | `""` (empty) in toleration | ✅   | Valid: matches all effects |
| `key` | `""` with `Exists` | ✅   | Tolerate all keys/values |
| `key` | `""` with `Equal` | ❌   | Invalid: key must be non-empty |
| `key` | Omitted | ❌ if operator `Equal` | Valid only with `Exists` operator |
| `operator` | Omitted | Defaults to `Equal` | Must provide `value` if `Equal` |

* * *

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

* * *

## ❓ **What if you omit `value` in a Toleration?**

It depends on which `operator` you use in the toleration.

* * *

## ✅ Toleration Structure Recap

A toleration in a Pod spec looks like this:

```yaml
tolerations:
- key: "key1"
  operator: "Equal"        # or "Exists"
  value: "value1"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
```

* * *

## 🔍 Now, what if `value` is omitted?

### ✅ 1. **If `operator: Exists` → `value` is optional and usually omitted**

```yaml
tolerations:
- key: "env"
  operator: "Exists"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
```

This toleration means:

> “Tolerate any taint with key `env` and effect `NoSchedule`, regardless of the value.”

✅ **This is valid and common.**

* * *

### ❌ 2. **If `operator: Equal` → `value` is **required**.**

```yaml
tolerations:
- key: "env"
  operator: "Equal"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
```

This will give an error like:

```
error validating pod: toleration with operator 'Equal' requires a value
```

So:

- ✅ `Equal` requires a `value`
    
- ✅ `Exists` does **not** require a `value`
    

* * *

## 🧠 Quick Summary

| Operator | `value` Required? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Equal` | ✅ Yes | Must match both key and value |
| `Exists` | ❌ No | Only checks key (and optionally effect) |

* * *

## ✅ Example Use Cases

### Tolerate all taints with a certain key:

```yaml
tolerations:
- key: "env"
  operator: "Exists"
```

### Tolerate only specific taint:

```yaml
tolerations:
- key: "env"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "prod"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
```

* * *

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

If setting `effect: ""` in a **taint** or **toleration** YAML is a good way to explore how Kubernetes handles empty values.

* * *

## ❓What happens if you write `effect: ""`?

### 🔥 **Short Answer:**

- In a **taint**: `effect: ""` is **invalid** — it will cause an error.
    
- In a **toleration**: `effect: ""` is **valid**, and it means the toleration applies to **all taint effects** (`NoSchedule`, `PreferNoSchedule`, `NoExecute`).
    

* * *

## 📦 1. **In a Taint** (on a Node)

```yaml
taints:
- key: "env"
  value: "prod"
  effect: ""
```

### ❌ This will fail.

Kubernetes **requires a valid effect** in taints:

- `NoSchedule`
    
- `PreferNoSchedule`
    
- `NoExecute`
    

You'll get an error like:

```text
invalid value for effect: ""
```

* * *

## 📦 2. **In a Toleration** (on a Pod)

```yaml
tolerations:
- key: "env"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "prod"
  effect: ""
```

### ✅ This is valid.

When `effect` is empty in a **toleration**, it means:

> "Tolerate taints with this key and value, regardless of their effect."

So the toleration matches **any taint** with:

- `key = env`
    
- `value = prod`
    
- **effect = any of the 3** (`NoSchedule`, `PreferNoSchedule`, `NoExecute`)
    

* * *

## 🧠 Summary

| Context | `effect: ""` Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Taint** | ❌ Invalid — must specify a valid effect |
| **Toleration** | ✅ Valid — matches **all effects** with the given key/value |

* * *

&nbsp;

An empty key means "match all keys and values" → so only `Exists` operator makes sense.

| Key | Operator Allowed | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `key: ""` | `Exists` only | Tolerate all taints with any key/value |
| `key: <val>` | `Equal` or `Exists` | Match specific key or just the key |

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Default Implementation: Node Unreachable / Not Ready Handling in Kubernetes

* * *

## 1\. **Node Health Condition Changes**

- When a node becomes:
    
    - **Unreachable** (e.g., network failure)
        
    - **Not Ready** (e.g., kubelet down)
        
- Kubernetes detects this via the **Node Controller**.
    

* * *

## 2\. **Automatic Taint Addition**

Kubernetes automatically adds special **NoExecute taints** to the affected node:

| Taint Key | Effect | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable` | `NoExecute` | Node is unreachable |
| `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready` | `NoExecute` | Node is not ready |

- Taints (on nodes) **don’t have an operator**.
    
- Tolerations (on pods) **must have an operator**, and for default system tolerations.
    

- These taints mark the node as **unhealthy**.

* * *

## 3\. **What Does the `NoExecute` Taint Effect Mean?**

- Tells the **Kubelet and Scheduler** to **evict pods** that **do NOT tolerate** this taint.
    
- **Pods without matching tolerations:**
    
    - **Immediately evicted** (terminated and rescheduled elsewhere).
- **Pods with matching tolerations:**
    
    - Can continue to run **temporarily** on the node.

* * *

## 4\. **The `tolerationSeconds` Field**

| Property | Default Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tolerationSeconds` | **300 seconds** (5 minutes) | Time pods with tolerations can stay on a tainted node before eviction |

- Allows pods to stay on an unhealthy node **up to 5 minutes**.
    
- Kubernetes waits this time for the node to **recover**.
    
- If the node doesn't recover in this period, pods are **evicted after 300 seconds**.
    

* * *

## 5\. **Do Pods Get Tolerations Automatically?**

&nbsp;

### ✅ Default Tolerations Automatically Added by Kubernetes

Kubernetes automatically adds the following tolerations to all pods:

```yaml
- key: "node.kubernetes.io/not-ready"
  operator: "Exists"
  effect: "NoExecute"
  tolerationSeconds: 300

- key: "node.kubernetes.io/unreachable"
  operator: "Exists"
  effect: "NoExecute"
  tolerationSeconds: 300
```

### 📌 Behavior:

- These are **only added if not already defined** in the pod spec.
    
- They allow pods to **remain on a node for 5 minutes** if it becomes `NotReady` or `Unreachable`.
    
- After 300 seconds, if the node is still unhealthy, the pod is **evicted**.
    

This default behavior ensures pods have a grace period before eviction during temporary node issues

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

* * *

## 6\. **Why Do Some Pods Stay Running After Node Issues?**

- **System pods** (like `kube-proxy`, `coredns`) include these tolerations **by default** in their manifests.
    
- This enables them to **stay running during short node outages**.
    
- User workloads **need to add tolerations manually** to get the same behavior.
    

* * *

## 7\. **Example: Toleration for Node Unreachable Taint**

```yaml
tolerations:
- key: "node.kubernetes.io/unreachable"
  operator: "Exists"
  effect: "NoExecute"
  tolerationSeconds: 300
```

> This toleration allows the pod to stay on a node that is unreachable for up to 300 seconds.

* * *

## 8\. **Summary Table**

| Step | Responsible Component | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add `NoExecute` taints | Kubernetes Node Controller | Marks node as unhealthy |
| Add tolerations to pods | Pod spec author (manual) | Allows pods to tolerate taints and stay temporarily |
| Evict pods without toleration | Kubelet / Scheduler | Pods are evicted immediately |
| Pods with toleration + `tolerationSeconds` | Kubelet / Scheduler | Pods stay for up to 300 seconds before eviction |

* * *
