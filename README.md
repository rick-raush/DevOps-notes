# DevOps Notes

This repository is my personal DevOps learning journal and backup of notes exported from Joplin.  
I use it to track everything I learn about DevOps tools, concepts, and best practices in an organized way.

---

## Purpose

- Maintain a version-controlled backup of my Joplin notes.
- Centralize my DevOps learning progress and resources.
- Easily track changes and improvements over time.

---

## Structure

- Notes are exported from Joplin in Markdown format.
- Certain folders or files may be excluded from git via `.gitignore` to keep the repo clean.
- Each export updates this repository with the latest notes and learning content.

---

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

        git clone https://github.com/rick-raush/DevOps-notes.git

````

2. Browse the notes to review or add new learnings.

3. To update the repository with new notes:

   * Export notes from Joplin.
   * Stage, commit, and push changes to GitHub:

     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Updated notes"
     git push
     ```

---

## Automation (Optional)

You can automate the export and git commit/push process using scripts combined with scheduling tools like `cron` or macOS `launchd`.
