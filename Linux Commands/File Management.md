## **1️⃣ Command: `find . \( -name ".terraform*" -o -name ".terragrunt*" \) -exec rm -rv {} +`**

### 🔹 Breakdown:

- `find .`
    
    - Starts searching in the current directory `.` and all subdirectories recursively.
- `\( -name ".terraform*" -o -name ".terragrunt*" \)`
    
    - `-name ".terraform*"` → matches any file or directory starting with `.terraform`
        
    - `-o` → logical OR
        
    - `-name ".terragrunt*"` → matches any file or directory starting with `.terragrunt`
        
    - The `\(` and `\)` are required to group the OR condition in `find`.
        
- `-exec rm -rv {} +`
    
    - For each match, execute `rm -rv` on it.
        
    - `{}` → placeholder for the matched file/directory
        
    - `+` → runs `rm` on multiple files at once (more efficient than `\;`)
        
    - `rm -rv` flags explained below
        

### 🔹 Flags for `rm -rv`:

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `-r` | recursive — deletes directories and their contents |
| `-v` | verbose — prints each file/folder as it is removed |

* * *

### 🔹 Key point:

- `find` **traverses all subdirectories** automatically.
    
- It will match **both files and directories** anywhere in the directory tree.
    
- Very safe when you want recursive deletion based on patterns.
    

* * *

## **2️⃣ Command: `rm -rvf ".terraform*" ".terragrunt*"`**

### 🔹 Breakdown:

- `rm` → remove command
    
- Flags:
    
    - `-r` → recursive
        
    - `-v` → verbose
        
    - `-f` → force (ignore nonexistent files, don’t prompt for confirmation)
        
- `".terraform*" ".terragrunt*"` → shell globbing patterns, **expanded by the shell before `rm` runs**.
    

* * *

### 🔹 Behavior:

- Only matches files/directories in **the current directory**.
    
- Does **not traverse subdirectories**.
    
- If no matches are found, zsh (without `nullglob`) will throw an error.
    
- Quoting the pattern prevents the shell from interpreting the glob, but then `rm` itself does not expand globs — it will fail unless you enable glob expansion in `rm` (which it doesn’t by default).
    

* * *

## **3️⃣ Comparison**

| Feature | `rm -rvf ".terraform*" ".terragrunt*"` | `find . -name ... -exec rm -rv {} +` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Recursive | Only deletes directories recursively if they are in current directory, not inside subdirs | True recursion through all subdirectories |
| Pattern match | Shell globbing, limited to current directory | Uses `find` with `-name` or regex; can search anywhere |
| Verbose | Yes (`-v`) | Yes (`rm -v`) |
| Force deletion | Yes (`-f`) | `rm` can be combined with `-f` if needed |
| Safety | Can fail silently or delete unintended files if glob misused | Safer — only deletes files that actually match pattern |
| Handles dotfiles in subdirs | No  | Yes |
| Works across all shells | Glob expansion can behave differently | Works reliably across bash, zsh, etc. |

* * *

### **✅ TL;DR**

- Use `rm -rvf` for **quick deletion in the current directory**.
    
- Use `find ... -exec rm -rv {} +` for **recursively deleting patterns in all subdirectories** — much safer and reliable.

## 🔗 **Links in Linux**

Linux filesystems allow **links**, which are basically shortcuts or references to files or directories. There are two main types:

### 1\. **Hard Links**

- A **hard link** is like an additional name for the same file.
    
- Both the original file and hard link point to the same data (inode) on disk.
    
- Deleting one hard link **does not delete the actual file data** as long as one link remains.
    
- Hard links **cannot span across different filesystems** (partitions).
    
- You **cannot create hard links to directories** (usually restricted to avoid loops).
    

**Example:**

```bash
ln file.txt file_hardlink.txt
```

- `file_hardlink.txt` is now another name for `file.txt`.
    
- Changes to either affect the same file content.
    

* * *

### 2\. **Symbolic (Soft) Links**

- A **symbolic link (symlink)** is like a shortcut or pointer to another file or directory.
    
- It stores the **path** to the target file or directory.
    
- If the target is deleted or moved, the symlink becomes broken (dangling link).
    
- Symlinks **can cross filesystem boundaries**.
    
- Symlinks **can point to directories**.
    

**Example:**

```bash
ln -s /path/to/original/file.txt shortcut.txt
```

- `shortcut.txt` points to `/path/to/original/file.txt`.
    
- Opening `shortcut.txt` opens the target file.
    

* * *

### Differences at a glance

| Feature | Hard Link | Symbolic Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Points to | Same inode (file data) | Path to file/directory |
| Can link directories? | No (usually restricted) | Yes |
| Can cross filesystems? | No  | Yes |
| Breaks if target deleted? | No (file data remains if at least one hard link exists) | Yes (dangling link) |
| Uses disk space? | No additional (just directory entry) | Small space for storing path |

* * *

### How to check links?

Use `ls -l` to see links:

```bash
ls -l file.txt file_hardlink.txt shortcut.txt
```

- Hard links have the same inode number (first column).
    
- Symbolic links show `->` followed by the target.

### ✅ Filesystem and Mounted On

- **Filesystem** = *where storage comes from*
    
    - Disk → `/dev/nvme0n1p1`
        
    - Memory → `tmpfs`, `devtmpfs`
        
    - Virtual → `proc`, `sysfs`
        
- **Mounted on** = *directory path where that storage is attached*
    

* * *

### 🔹 Key idea

Linux has **one directory tree (`/`)**.  
Different filesystems are **mounted into directories** inside it.

* * *

### 🔹 Examples

- `tmpfs` → memory → mounted on `/run`
    
- `devtmpfs` → memory → mounted on `/dev`
    
- `/dev/nvme0n1p1` → disk → mounted on `/`
    

* * *

### 🔑 One-line rule

> **Filesystem = storage source | Mounted on = directory location**

That’s it.
